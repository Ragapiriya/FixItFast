<h1>FixItFast 🚗 - <i>A Vehicle-service reservation Web application</i></h1>
<p> <b></b>FixItFast is built using the <i>MERN</i> (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, offering a modern, full-stack JavaScript solution for efficient development and scalability. The app leverages MongoDB as the NoSQL database to store user details, reservation data, and service information. Express serves as the backend framework, while React powers the dynamic and responsive frontend, ensuring a seamless user experience. Node.js handles server-side operations, providing efficient data processing and API management.

For authentication, FixItFast integrates Auth0, enabling secure user logins and protecting sensitive user data. Redux is used to manage state across the app, ensuring smooth reservation management and handling of user information. The app incorporates security best practices, addressing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, vulnerable and outdated components, and software integrity failures. The platform supports both user and admin roles, with role-based access control (RBAC), where roles are securely passed through tokens managed by Auth0. 

By combining modern web technologies, secure authentication, and strong security measures, FixItFast delivers a reliable and user-friendly vehicle service reservation platform for both users and administrators.</p>
